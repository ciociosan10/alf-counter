alf-counter

Sample project demonstrating how to create and maintain a counter in Alfresco for generating sequences.

To build the project, copy build.properties.sample to build.properties and edit it to suit your environment. Then use the Ant target "deploy".

A JUnit test class based on RestAssured has been built to exercise the webscripts once they're deployed.
